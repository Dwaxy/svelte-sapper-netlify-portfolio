#  Team Application Development Assignment, a Web Graphic Store

This was a full stack team project in which we developed a full-stack web application based on Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Vue. I worked with two others, and everyone had a go at everything, such as the design, front and back end, and planning, including scrum meetings. Here is what I contributed to the project:

## Project Owner
I acted as the Git repository owner for this assignment. It was my responsibility to merge the teams pull request and resolve any conflicts, as well as letting the team know when they should pull from upstream when there were significant changes like new features or bug fixes. 

There were several occasions where team members asked me to find previous code they had pushed but then lost, as well as solving sync issues we had with git by pushing certain changes in a specific order. 

Taking on the role of project owner allowed me to play to my strength of being the member with more code experience, as I was given an overview of the codebase and the project's progress as a whole. This allowed me to support the team in planning and giving troubleshooting support, often saving them time by pointing them towards an existing method or component they could reference off or copy.

## Roadblocks

My computer's graphics card started affecting workflow with major issues at random issues on week 3 of development. This made me switch to a laptop. While I could hook up an external monitor, I was lacking software and passwords and this hindered me. For whatever reason, the latest version of our codebase did not include bug fixes. I spent two days on these. I had to resolve them three days before the deadline. 


## Additional Roles
Throughout the project, I was often updating the Trello board. I was also the one to set it up and divide up use cases in the backlog. With my previous experience with development, I was able to leave an outline of needed tasks within the use cases, giving us a rough guide as we developed. Being the project owner with a birds-eye view of the codebase, I was also adjusting deadlines and planning ahead to prioritise the code that we needed to aim for the minimum viable product.

I also had a strong role in helping troubleshoot and debug code. I directed what needed to be done and communicated code patterns to the other members, especially when use cases overlapped. I would be called to walk through and issue or explain things on vue, front end working with back end semi often throughout the entire thing. I believe the team appreciated the very basic explanations with me trying to relate the answer to their current situations. I did this  without making it into a lesson but going over it enough for them to come to the conclusion themselves.


## Additional Notes
Akash and Chris showed a brave willingness to do things a little differently and to try new things in this assignment. I suggested we keep the backend and front end folders in the same repository, rather than as two different projects. This worked out well. It \was simpler for everyone in regards to version control. 

Akash and Chris both decide they wanted to try the sass syntax, just because it was something new. This worked out relatively well. However, one member had lost some time learning the smacks styling philosophy, as he had only used BEM in past projects.

At the start of development, Akash was tasked with setting up some basic express routes so we would be able to jump into the front end faster. Instead, he came back with a new file layout for the back end, abstracting away a lot of boilerplate code. This worked out well for everyone after they spend a moment to familiarise themselves with it. He also came back with an extensive tool to seed test data into the database. Members putting in extra learning to improve our productivity was constant. The team strove to learn new things during the process. 

## Trelloâ€™s and use case list:
- [The Development Trello](https://trello.com/b/32bCF4WT/artmarket-dev)

- [The Planning Trello](https://trello.com/b/tjNG9T5w/artmarket-planning)

## Use cases / Components / Tasks I did:
- Set up git repo
- Component planning
- The other members wanted to plan out some needed components to have an idea of what the site code structure would look like. With my past experience with component libraries, I was able - to walk them through this.
- Set up MongoDB Atlas
- Header.vue
- I had a lot of involvement in this component. Chris was having trouble with the logic, as the nav has several different states and functions using things like imported services. There - - were many bugs that were ongoing throughout the project in this component.
- Set up base front end vue routes
- User Profile / Bio
- Chris was assigned this use case but I ended up solving it when I worked on the seller items use case
- Created skeleton files of components we knew we would need
- JS Style guide
- The view items use case, this includes
- ViewItemsDetasiled.vue
- ViewItemsGetItems.vue
- ViewItemsGrid.vue
- All needed back end routes
- These components are used in both the view items and view items from a user use cases
- Admin create item
- CreateItem.vue
- UserProfile.vue 
- All back end routes involved 

## Tasks I was given in the planning stage:
- I had the initial client meeting early to give our team a head start
- Personas
- Usability goals
- Requirements gathering (with input from Chris)
- User need statements (with input from Chris)
- User flow diagram
- UML diagram
- Information Architecture diagram
- Back end entity relationship diagram
- I helped with input for:
- User testing
- Low and high fidelity designs
- Target audience 


## Incomplete
Due to the roadblocks we encountered as a team, as well as personally, some use cases we could not get to or complete in time. They were:

Above all the edit item and edit user functionality (the only use case I missed, but a major one)
The comments were almost complete but we ran out of time to implement them
The buy item model was not completed before my personal submission
Minor styling issues, mostly image cropping and component resizing

I will have to personally implement these when it comes to making this project a portfolio item.
