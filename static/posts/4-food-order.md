# Burger Burger In House Food Ordering App

The main focus for this assignment was on UX, with tons of documentation on user testing, research and findings throughout the UX process. A full [UX Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U_nw2TfPag7F9sMFcUzXt_hxPxT8S4fMLIf6E5-pUls/edit?usp=sharing) was made for this project. A brief outline of the [design procces](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1okB1sW1BD3HjDat9llwHRSf5dHJ18qww2Okr5YSXdNA/edit?usp=sharing) was also made, though UX was the main focus of this project, rather than design and development 
 
The stack was simple DOM manipulation using jQuery and vanilla javascript. Competence in the basics is important.
