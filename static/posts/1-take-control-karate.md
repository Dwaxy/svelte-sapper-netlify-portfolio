# Take Control - Canterbury Go Ju Ryu Karate Club Site Remake

## Brief

I decided to remake my karate club's website for my last assignment, as the original greatly deserved a remake. Understanding an organisation and then accurately portraying it on the web in an attractive way is the ultimate goal for businesses on the web. Therefore this was a unique opportunity for me, as I have an inside perspective of the organisation, and want to give a shot at its accurate portrayal online.

## Target Audience

Our main clients are young males. We want to target boys as young as eight years old. Women’s self-defence is also a niche we cater to. A lot of our customers are parents of our younger clients. The site must be inclusive and welcoming to parents in particular 

## User Personas

**Karen**

47, has a son and a daughter aged 11 and 12. She wants them to be more active, and to have positive male role models as she is a single mum. She likes the idea of her kids gaining discipline and pushing their limits.

**Grim**

62, wants to be more involved with his grandkids. He likes to watch and support them in class, and it reminds him of doing training in his youth. He likes to train with them as a way of spending time with them and keeping fit with them outside of class

**Tom**

16, likes the idea of becoming a badass. Being a weaker teenager he is looking for a supportive community to help him gain powers and serious skill.

**Allie**

18, interested in fitness, and looking for a supportive community in which she can gain the self-confidence she needs for effective self-defence.


## How Might We

**How might we make the site legitimate and professional in the eyes of parents wanting their kids to gain fitness, discipline and self-defence?**

Communicate through copy that most of the students are in the kids class and that most of the adults are present during class. And furthermore, that classes are fun, challenging and rewarding for everyone.

**How might we make the site appealing to younger kids? How can we present martial arts as something that they want to try?**

Images and or videos of kids having fun and achieving, and showing that kids are treated with respect, and are rewarded for their hard work.

**How might we make the site appealing to young adult men/teen boys as a lifestyle through which they can gain confidence?**

Showing young men their age training and gaining skills from older experienced artists and with people the same age as them.

**How might we make the site appealing to women and girls to gain confidence and self-defence skills?**

Highlighting the significant involvement of the younger and older women of the club, while showing that the club is a safe environment where they are understood and encouraged. Including the male instructors so it is clear that the females are getting the real deal when it comes to their protection and confidence.

**How might we communicate the spectrum the club offers, from being a fun fitness activity through to serious training for martial arts?**

Show a variety of images and other content in a balanced mix, highlighting the casual social side and people achieving awards and belts within the club.

**How might we effectively showcase the culture and values of this traditional karate style?**

Use the content of the existing site as there is little chance of the client publishing false information about his own style, including images of the club training with the Okinawan masters. Copy the history and origins of the style from the existing site.


## Project Requirements

Based on the research thus far, along with the current content on the existing client site, some base requirements for the site remake might be:

- A landing page with a specific design to target the right audiences
- A dedicated place for images and history 
- Location, fees, and timetable information
- Special attention paid to representing varying clients such as kids and women

As this is a site for a client, a CMS must be used. This comes with its own user goals. These may be added to if a feature is found to be needed that requires such attention. So far the hard requirements for the admin/site owner are:

- Must use WordPress
- Editable pages must be clear, with a clear information hierarchy 
- Straightforward to edit
- Clear instructions on how to use the CMS is provided, and
- tools/sections of the admin page to do with development or not relevant to the client are pointed out


## Accessibility and Inclusivity

Based on the information architecture, the site needs to be accessible to both kids and potentially older (parents). This will be done by researching and following accessibility code standards and testing them using tools like screen readers to ensure the code meets an acceptable accessibility standard. This will also aid the site in SEO, though the clients business is not relying on online marketing. There is an opportunity to make the colours of the design high contrast and have it fit well with the subject matter. This will be tested with tools to determine its suitability for those with colour blindness.

The most direct way to ensure the site is inclusive and does not close itself off to potential clients are images of diverse people partaking in the club. This is largely dependent on the client providing that content. As we aim to provide an example of the site’s fullest potential on launch, images will be outsourced if the current content is not representative of the club (images on the current site are very old). In regards to cultural considerations for the design, it is essential for the branding it reflects the karate aesthetics. Taking into account it is a New Zealand business, the site will be in English, obviously. Though some branding like the logo will have Japanese characters. This will enhance the design.

## User testing and Gap Assessment

The existing site was tested with real users. The test was marked not only on the useability and aesthetic, but it’s effectiveness at communicating it’s message under several contexts. One tester was told she was looking for a club for her kids to join. Another was looking for women's self-defence. The last was simply interested in training in martial arts. All were questioned on how well the site sold itself to them and their different goals. What we found:

The site navigation worked well and was clear, the design works, despite it not being very modern. The instructor’s page was pleasing to everyone, seeming professional and personal. It helped give the impression of a strong traditional community dedicated to the art. Those interested in the history of martial arts found ht etext informative. Those who were not interested skipped it. 

The feedback suggests there is too much text, especially on the home page. The text on the home page led users to believe that it was solely a kid-focused activity. The style name, while accurate and important, was too long with its full title. It needs “karate” as the main highlight on landing. The gallery content is very out-of-date, with the oldest photos showing first. The question “Is it for adults?” came up despite the user having further explored the site.

It was never clearly stated where to go on the site or what to do to sign up, though all found the contact information fine and seemed satisfied with that. There were several suggestions for a “book lesson” button under the locations cards. As the club is run on just showing up at a lesson on time and arranging things there, this might not work as there is no direct way of making an appointment aside from phoning an instructor. 

## Style Tile

Ideas were taken from other karate sites in New Zealand. These employ various features such as calendars and upcoming events. There was no indication from the testing that these are needed. The features and content in the existing site proved more than adequate, even if it is not pretty. There is ample opportunity for strong, high contrast colours, and for simple, bold design, while still remaining unique, based off this style tile.

## Typography

For typography, the branding of the site would benefit from big, bold lettering for header text, reminiscent of the magazines and karate competitions of the 80s - 90s, though we won’t be going for that exact style. The fonts must be bold, but easy to read. It is important to note that the fonts must be subtle, and not become a gimmick as it may harm the professionalism of the site

Raleway was a surprisingly good fit when thickness is added. It is a common font and therefore more likely to be cached on the user’s machine, which is a huge advantage. It also pairs well with Open sans and Roboto, which are also very common. Raleway has just enough flair, as opposed to Teko, which is fitting but might be a little too much. Work Sans and Montserrat are also honourable mentions, though finding the main text that fits might be more challenging.

## Low Fidelity Designs

Based on the style tile and feedback from the gap assessment, this is the low fidelity design. For testing, the tester was only told that it was a karate club site and the names of the pages. The tester managed to point out the purpose of every object on the pages, with the exception of two things that needed to be pointed out but would be obvious if it was a full design with text. The grey parts of instructors are images, and the title of the locations section, which would say “locations”. The only feedback given for the design was “the theme is a bit dark” and “needs more colour”, both of which the tester dropped after she saw the images that would be used from the existing site.

## High Fidelity Designs

![Alt text](/images/karate-5.png "The first high fidelity")

These designs are very close to the low fidelity above. The main difference is that they have been filled with content from the existing site. While the images on the existing site are a number of years out-of-date, the Facebook page is not. This design is a massive improvement in regards to reflecting and representing the club. The colour scheme turned out to be robust and high contrast, fitting to the karate aesthetics, while highlighting the content like images and text.

The design was overlooked by someone experienced with typography and basic design, the feedback received and acted upon was:

Improvements to text hierarchy on the location page
Footer content layout
Justify blurb text to the right on home page

The design also underwent specialized review and changed dramatically. Notably, there was the addition of more colour and highlights; the original was far too dark. There were also layout and image improvements on the home page, with large text making a big impact, with a call to actions to key places, such as the newly-added “about” page. Most importantly, there were many more images added, with a focus of including young children, serious training, and women, to represent the diversity of the club. The client had some high-quality content that really displays the club's character. Even if those images might not be up to the quality of a professional site, it adds to the charm and has a karate aesthetic. For instance, the hero image on the home page.

## Final Design:

## Stack and Plugins

The base of the stack will be simple. Wordpress was used as the CMS and the APIthe template pages will be server-side rendered. The base WordPress theme will be underscores, a common starting theme. This is a good choice because of its simplicity, made even more simple by leaving out the extra options, allowing the file structure to be kept to a minimum. Another theme, Sage, was considered for its better developer experience through its templating engine. This was discarded due to issues encountered during testing. Though the theme we picked lacks the feature set of Sage, sometimes it is best to demonstrate simple execution using the existing tech. 

Sass was also used. This saved time setting up the file structure. Mixins and variables also sped the development of the site.

Wordpress Plugins were adopted as needed. Some of these were essential for added features. Advanced Custom Fields played a key role in the customizability and extensions of custom post types, added through a small custom plugin developed by ourselves. Contact Form 7 was also used for the contact form.

For image optimization, several plugins were tested. These required email signup for API keys to outsourcing the compression. This takes the power away from the client, as a transfer and re-setup would be needed. It turns out the top plugin Smush does the job on-site and is straightforward for the client, with automatic compression.

For security, WordFence was installed. However, it requires an email for the installation to complete. This would take power away from the client without their details, so setup would be competed on transfer.
